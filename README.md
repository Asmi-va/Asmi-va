# README for Asmi Vashista's GitHub Profile

## About Me

Hello! I'm Asmi Vashista, a passionate data enthusiast who loves to explore the world of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my skills and allow me to learn new technologies. 

## Interests

- **Data Science**: Analyzing and interpreting complex data to help make informed decisions.
- **Machine Learning**: Building predictive models and algorithms to solve real-world problems.
- **Neural Networks**: Exploring the capabilities of neural networks through projects like self-driving simulations and game AI.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### 1. Self-Driving Car Simulation
- **Description**: A simulation that uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks that control self-driving cars in a Pygame environment.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pygame, NEAT-Python
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time visualization of cars navigating a track.
  - Collision detection and radar systems for obstacle avoidance.
  - Fitness evaluation based on distance traveled.

### 2. Flappy Bird AI
- **Description**: An AI implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using NEAT to train birds to navigate through pipes.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pygame, NEAT-Python
- **Key Features**:
  - Birds learn to fly through pipes by adjusting their jump height.
  - Visualization of generations and fitness scores.
